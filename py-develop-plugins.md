### About Flow's Python plugins

Python plugins use the [JSON-RPC](https://flow-launcher.github.io/docs/#/json-rpc) protocol to communicate with Flow via JSON structured calls.

When building a Python plugins there are several things to be mindful of:

* The most important thing is we do not expect users to have to manually install the dependencies in requirements.txt because we aim to provide a seamless experience for them. This can be achieved by adding the following three things to your project:
    1. Add a GitHub workflow- use a GitHub workflow that will install all your plugin's depedencies including the Python flowlauncher module to a folder called Lib inside your plugin.
    2. Publish all as a zip- zip up your project including a lib directory that contains the modules and publish it to GitHub Releases page.
    3. Point your module imports to the lib directory- reference all the modules to that directory where they are first imported.

* User can use their own system installed Python with Flow Launcher. But in most circumstances they will most likely be using Flow Launcher's own embedded Python executable. [Embedded Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-embeddable-package) is isolated from the users system and does not prepend the scripts run directory to the system `PATH`.<sup>[ref](https://bugs.python.org/issue28245)</sup> If you need to import external files please follow the example below.

### Simple Example
Have a look at this simple example plugin [here](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher.Plugin.HelloWorldPython), notice it has a folder called '.github/workflows' and a file called 'Publish Release.yml'. This is the workflow file that GitHub Workflow uses to run the CICD for the project. Moving out of that folder you can go into the [main.py](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher.Plugin.HelloWorldPython/blob/main/main.py) file, this is the entry file for your plugin. Notice it has this code block:
```python
import sys,os
parent_folder_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
sys.path.append(parent_folder_path)
sys.path.append(os.path.join(parent_folder_path, 'lib'))
sys.path.append(os.path.join(parent_folder_path, 'plugin'))
```
