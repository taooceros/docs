# Query.Search property

Search part of a query. This will not include action keyword if exclusive plugin gets it, otherwise it should be same as RawQuery. Since we allow user to switch a exclusive plugin to generic plugin, so this property will always give you the "real" query part of the query

```csharp
public string Search { get; }
```
